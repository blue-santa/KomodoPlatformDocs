Change Log (HyperDEX)
*********************

.. note::

	Keep in mind that HyperDEX is currently in alpha release. Although the risk of loss of funds is minimal, it could take some troubleshooting/contact with our supportstaff to resolve issues. Only trade in real currency if you can take that risk. We recommend trading in the test currencies ``BEER`` and ``PIZZA`` instead. You can get ``BEER`` for free `here <https://www.atomicexplorer.com/#/faucet>`_.

Remember to report issues through the ``Feedback`` button in the app.
