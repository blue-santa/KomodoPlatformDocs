1 - The casual user: Sarah

Kate is in her 20's. She is comfortable with computer devices, but she does not know how to write code, nor does she want to build a business. She has a day job that keeps her busy. She wants to download user-friendly software and start using it as fast as possible.
When she comes to Komodo, she wants to download software, open it, and use it as fast as possible.
She'll read instructions, if need be, but she hopes that the user interface will explain the software for her.

2 - The business investor: Stan

Steve is in his early forties. He has a team of people who work for him and he's got a healthy amount of capital to invest. He doesn't write code, but he's been around technology enough that he's comfortable in a tech-savvy environment. Steve is looking to invest in blockchain technology, and wants to build on a platform that will support his future.
He's looking for the primary selling points, and he wants to have all his questions answered as quickly as possible.
Decision matrixes are very persuasive, but he'll read through more, if need be.

3 - The smart-contract developer: Matthew

Matthew is in his early thirties. He has several years of experience writing code, but blockchain technology itself is new. He can figure things out pretty quickly, if provided accurate documentation. He doesn't really care about the GUI software, but he wants the RPC calls to be easy to pick up, simple and reliable to use, and well explained in the documentation. He's also hoping to adopt a smart contract language that has a large support community, so that if he gets stuck, there's someone to help him get unstuck asap.
